# tap-backendtest

## Objective
* Make testing easy for developers to improve **code quality**
* Adopt testing to systems which are deemed enterprise grade, not POCs


## Concepts
* Isolation : test only 1 layer each time and mock everything else
* 

## Benefits
* Improve code quality
* Increase comfort when doing hand take over
* Decrease the amount of time to create new feature on top of existing system 
* Lesser help desk call


## What to test & why test / Minimal Code coverage
* API
  * Test other APIs that your app is consuming and asser the result to be the same

* Controllers
  * Do integration testing from end to end up till persisting data into database. 
  * Do not only do unit testing of controller.

## Mocking
* Create your own java mock classes 
   * Easy readabiliy
   * Low learning curve
* Using Mockito
   * Power mockito
