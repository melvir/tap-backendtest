# TAP-Guide to Backend Test

## Objective
* Make testing easy for developers to improve **code quality**
* Adopt testing to systems which are deemed enterprise grade, not POCs

## Test Layers
The example applicationn shows different test layers according to the [Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html).

```

  End-to-End
    ╱────╲
   ╱ Inte-╲

╱   Unit     ╲

```

## Application Architecture
```

                └──────────┘
                     ↑ JSON/HTTP
                     ↓
                ┌──────────┐

                │ Weather  │
                │   API    │
                └──────────┘
```

## Concepts
* Isolation : test only 1 layer each time and mock everything else
* 

## Benefits
* Improve code quality
* Increase comfort when doing hand take over
* Decrease the amount of time to create new feature on top of existing system 
* Lesser help desk call


## What to test & why test / Minimal Code coverage
* API
  * Test other APIs that your app is consuming and asser the result to be the same
  * Test JSON response

* Controllers
  * Do integration testing from end to end up till persisting data into database. 
  * Do not only do unit testing of controller (does not contain any business-logic)
  
* Services
  * Mock the repository (either by using Mockito or custom POJO)
  * Do unit testing with aim to isolate it for testing business logic
  
* Repostories
  * Only applicable for custom query methods (e.g. jpa /jpl)
  * Using DataJpaTest
  
* Model
  * Do not test

## Do's and Don't's
* Do not test the parameter 
* Test the input and output 

## Mocking
* Create your own Java mock classes
   * Pros
       * Easy readabiliy
       * Just have to reuse your existing Java skills
       * Dont need to keep up to date with Mokito standard
   * Cons
       * More coding effort 
* Using Mockito
   * Pros
       * Fast development of test cases
       * Huge boiler plate codes can be automatically generated 
   * Cons 
       * Tightly coupled to Mockito testing framework
       * Higher learning curve on Mockito API usage

## Techniques
* Use rest-assured to test specific JSON response by specifying the path.

## Environment Setup
* IDE : Intelli J
    * Install Lombok plugin under Settings > MarketPlace.    
* IDE : Eclipse
    * You will need to install the lombok plugin manually into the Eclipse by double clicking on the lombok.jar and go through the installation steps presented. Restart your IDE and rebuild your project for the installation to take effect. In your Java project, you will need to maunually include lombok.jar into your project build path.
    * Downloaded lombok.jar from https://projectlombok.org/download
